# Knowledge Graph Setup Instructions

## Overview
This document provides instructions for setting up the Knowledge Graph component of the GOK:AI project. The Knowledge Graph is essential for integrating various data sources and enabling intelligent reasoning and decision-making processes.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the Knowledge Graph, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
- Access to the necessary data sources for integration

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Mozg_Boga_MIGI
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Connectors**
   Edit the `connectors.py` file in the `knowledge_graph` directory to configure the data sources and connection settings as needed.

5. **Run the Knowledge Graph Setup**
   Execute the setup script to initialize the Knowledge Graph:
   ```
   python knowledge_graph/connectors.py
   ```

6. **Verify the Setup**
   Ensure that the Knowledge Graph is correctly set up by running any provided tests or checking the logs for successful initialization.

## Usage
Once the Knowledge Graph is set up, it can be utilized by the AGI Kernel and other components of the GOK:AI project to enhance decision-making capabilities and integrate diverse data sources.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the setup, please refer to the README files in the respective directories or consult the project documentation for further assistance.
