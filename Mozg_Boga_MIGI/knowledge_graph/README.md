# Knowledge Graph Component Documentation

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph component of the GOK:AI project serves as a crucial element in integrating and managing the relationships between various data entities. It enables the system to understand and utilize the connections between different pieces of information, enhancing the overall intelligence and decision-making capabilities of the AI.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the Knowledge Graph component, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. You can find the list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Configure Connectors**: Modify the `connectors.py` file to set up the connections to your data sources. This may include databases, APIs, or other data repositories.

3. **Run Setup Script**: Execute the setup script provided in `setup.md` to initialize the Knowledge Graph.

4. **Testing**: After setup, run the provided tests to ensure that the Knowledge Graph is functioning correctly and can integrate with other components of the GOK:AI system.

## Usage

The Knowledge Graph can be utilized in various ways, including:

- **Data Integration**: Seamlessly connect and integrate data from multiple sources.
- **Relationship Mapping**: Understand and visualize the relationships between different data entities.
- **Enhanced Decision Making**: Leverage the knowledge graph to improve the AI's decision-making processes by providing context and connections.

For more detailed instructions and examples, refer to the `setup.md` file and the `connectors.py` implementation.
