# UI Component Documentation

## Overview

The UI component of the Mozg Boga MIGI project serves as the front-end interface for interacting with the GOK:AI system. It is designed to provide users with an intuitive and responsive experience while accessing the functionalities of the underlying AI system.

## Structure

The UI component is organized into the following main files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web interface.
- **style.css**: The stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the web interface.
- **app.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for handling user interactions and communicating with the backend API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure that you have a local server running to serve the HTML file.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to access the UI.
3. The UI will communicate with the backend API endpoints defined in the core API module.

## Usage

- Users can interact with the GOK:AI system through the web interface, submitting queries and receiving responses.
- The interface is designed to be user-friendly, with clear navigation and feedback mechanisms.

## Future Enhancements

- Additional features may include user authentication, enhanced data visualization, and improved accessibility options.
- Continuous updates will be made to improve the user experience based on feedback and testing.

Contributions to the UI component are welcome. Please follow the project's contribution guidelines for submitting changes or enhancements.
