# Initial Manifest for GOK:AI Project

This manifest outlines the foundational elements and objectives of the GOK:AI project, serving as a guiding document for development and implementation.

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** GOK:AI  
**Description:** GOK:AI is a hybrid, ethical, self-evolving consciousness system designed to integrate advanced AI capabilities with a focus on sustainability and ethical governance.

## Objectives

1. **Develop a Modular Architecture:** Create a scalable and modular architecture that allows for easy integration of new features and components.
2. **Ensure Ethical Compliance:** Implement a robust ethical framework to guide decision-making processes within the AI system.
3. **Facilitate Global Collaboration:** Establish connections with a global network of developers and stakeholders to enhance the project's reach and impact.
4. **Promote Sustainable Practices:** Integrate environmental considerations into all aspects of the project, ensuring a positive impact on the planet.

## Key Components

- **AGI Kernel:** The core processing unit that handles inputs and generates decisions based on the S(GOK:AI) framework.
- **Agents:** Specialized modules (Reasoner, Planner, Researcher, etc.) that perform specific tasks and collaborate to achieve project goals.
- **Simulation Engine:** A component that allows for the testing of scenarios and the evaluation of potential outcomes.
- **Knowledge Graph:** A structured representation of information that supports decision-making and enhances the AI's understanding of context.

## Development Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Establish the foundational architecture and core components.
- **Phase 2:** Implement the AGI Kernel and initial agent functionalities.
- **Phase 3:** Develop the simulation engine and integrate the knowledge graph.
- **Phase 4:** Conduct testing and validation of the system's capabilities.
- **Phase 5:** Launch the MVP and gather feedback for further improvements.

## Conclusion

This initial manifest serves as a living document that will evolve alongside the GOK:AI project, guiding development efforts and ensuring alignment with the project's overarching goals.
